# Resolver to choose a 'specific' stackage snapshot or a compiler version.
# NOTE: this should eventually be a GHC 9.2.1 resolver, but as of this writing
#       (2022-03-29), there are no LTS resolvers using 9.2.1.  Although we don't
#       use the stock compiler, it'd help to ensure that the packages are
#       compatible with our GHC.
